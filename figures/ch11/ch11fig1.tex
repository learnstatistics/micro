\begin{TikzFigure}{xscale=0.3,yscale=0.25,descwidth=25em,caption={Demand, costs and market structure \label{fig:demandcostmarketstructure}},description={With a cost structure defined by $LATC_1$ this market has space for many firms -- perfect or monopolistic competition, each producing approximately $q_1$. If costs correspond to $LATC_2$, where scale economies are substantial, there may be space for just one producer. The intermediate case, $LATC_3$, can give rise to oligopoly, with each firm producing more than $q_1$ but less than a monopolist. These curves encounter their MES at very different output levels.}}
