Hence production possibilities are given by the points A, Z, and B. Pre-trade it produces at Z in each economy due to trade barriers. Post-trade it produces at A in one economy and B in the other, and ships the vehicles internationally. Total production increases from 160,000 to 200,000 using the same resources.}}
