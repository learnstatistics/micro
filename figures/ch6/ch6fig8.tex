\begin{TikzFigure}{xscale=0.38,yscale=0.32,descwidth=25em,caption={Indifference curves \label{fig:indiffcurves}},description={An indifference curve defines a series of consumption bundles, all of which yield the same satisfaction. The slope of an indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution ($MRS$) and defines the number of units of the good on the vertical axis that the individual will trade for one unit of the good on the horizontal axis. The $MRS$ declines as we move south-easterly, because the consumer values the good more highly when he has less of it.}}
