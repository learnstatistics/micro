\begin{TikzFigure}{xscale=0.36,yscale=0.3,descwidth=25em,caption={Deriving industry supply \label{fig:industrysupply}},description={The marginal cost curves for firms A and B indicate that at any price below $P_1$ production is unprofitable and supply is therefore zero for both firms. At prices between $P_1$ and $P_2$ firm A is willing to supply, but not firm B. Consequently the market supply comes only from A. At prices above $P_2$ both firms are willing to supply. Therefore the market supply is the horizontal sum of each firm's supply.}}
