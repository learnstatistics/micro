\begin{TikzFigure}{xscale=0.36,yscale=0.3,descwidth=25em,caption={Short-run supply for the competitive firm \label{fig:shortrunsupply}},description={A price below $P_1$ does not cover variable costs, so the firm should shut down. Between prices $P_1$ and $P_3$, the producer can cover variable, but not total, costs and therefore should produce in the short run if fixed costs are `sunk'. In the long run the firm must close if the price does not reach $P_3$. Profits are made if the price exceeds $P_3$. The short-run supply curve is the quantity supplied at each price. It is therefore the $MC$ curve above $P_1$.}}
