\textbf{Cross-price elasticity of demand} is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in the price of another.

\textbf{Income elasticity of demand} is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by a percentage change in income.

\textbf{Luxury good} or service is one whose income elasticity equals or exceeds unity.
