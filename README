Code Organization
-----------------

Extract the .zip file on your computer.  It will contain one directory,
"text". The two necessary style files are contained in this directory. 

The top-level Latex file is "CI-Principles-of-Microeconomics.tex".  This file lists all
of the required packages and imports the files "courseInfo.txt" and "CI-Principles-of-Microeconomics-Contents.tex" that define the content to be included in the textbook.


Customizing the Textbook
------------------------

To customize the text for your course:

1: Edit courseInfo.txt

  This file contains specific course and institution information to be
  displayed on title page.

2: Edit CI-Principles-of-Microeconomics-Contents.tex

  This file imports the chapter and section files that will define the content
  of the textbook.  Chapters and sections can be reorded in this file or
  removed.


Compiling
---------

This textbook is designed to be compiled using TeX Live 2015 but other
versions may work as well.  TeX Live can be downloaded from
https://www.tug.org/texlive/ .  You will need to look through their archive
to find older versions of the compiler.


On Linux: Add TeX Live 2015 to the PATH in your environment or edit the PATH
  defined in the Makefile.  Then run one of the commands below.

On Windows: Install the Cygwin command-line environment from
  https://www.cygwin.com/ and add TeX Live 2015 to the PATH in Cygwin.  Then
  run one of the commands below.  Alternatively, you can use one of the many
  Latex editors or the built-in Windows command-line and simply run TeX Live
  directly.

The Makefile:

This is provided for convenience to compile the textbook.  It invokes the
typical "latex, dvips, ps2pdf" chain of commands.  We use the "--jobname"
argument to latex to compile variations on the textbook such as for
print-on-demand services.

Run "make" to compile the main textbook, including cover page and solutions.

Run "make base-text" to compile the main textbook, including cover page and solutions, containing all material with no customizations.

Run "make print-cover" to compile the cover page only.

Run "make interior" to compile the interior of a print book without the cover page.

Run "make solutions", "make solutions-interior", "make solutions-print-cover" to compile 
these files for the exercise solutions.

Run "make clean" to clean directory and remove unnecessary files after compiling.
