\section{Individual and market functions}\label{sec:ch3sec8}

Markets are made up of many individual participants on the demand and supply
side. The supply and demand functions that we have worked with in this
chapter are those for the total of all participants on each side of the
market. But how do we arrive at such market functions when the economy is
composed of individuals? We can illustrate how, with the help of
Figure~\ref{fig:individualdemand}.

To concentrate on the essentials, imagine that there are just two buyers of
chocolate cookies in the economy. A has a stronger preference for cookies than B, so his demand is
greater. To simplify, let the two demands have the same intercept on the
vertical axis. The curves $D_A$ and $D_B$ indicate how many cookies A and
B, respectively, will buy at each price. The market demand indicates how
much they buy \textit{together} at any price. Accordingly, at $P_1$, A and B
purchase the quantities $Q_{A1}$ and $Q_{B1}$ respectively. Thus $Q_1=Q_{A1}+Q_{B1}$.
At a price $P_2$, they purchase $Q_{A2}$ and $Q_{B2}$. Thus $Q_2=Q_{A2}+Q_{B2}$.
The \terminology{market demand} is therefore the horizontal sum of the individual
demands at these prices. In the figure this is defined by $D_{market}$.
