Output is produced by the factors of production -- labour, capital, and land. In Chapter~\ref{chap:marketlabourcapital} we explore how the markets for these factors, or productive inputs, operate. We focus primarily on labour and capital.

Chapter~\ref{chap:humancapital} deals with human capital -- a broader concept than labour. The human capital embodied in a person depends upon her skills, education and experience, and this combination determines the rewards, or return, she obtains when employed. This chapter also explores the distribution of income in Canada and the degree of inequality in that distribution. It concludes with a brief overview of the `top one percent'.
